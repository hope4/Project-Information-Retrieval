done with information retrieval using
1. simple norming
2. qr decomposition using gram method
3. householder transformation
4. given's transform
5. svd decomposition

next verified the same query vector using all the above algorithms
1       we observe that svd decomposition is giving more accurate results

next derived the relative and absolute error ,forward error,obtained by chopping to three decimal points
1       we observe that svd decomposition is giving relatively less absoulute and relative error compared to other algorithms,hence more stable
2.    Qr decomposition using gram,householder,givens method almost given same forward error,hence equally stable.
